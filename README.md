# IRIS-CI Demo

A docker-compose.yml and one of my projects to demonstrate how IRIS-CI works.

## How to use

Simply go inside the folder where the docker-compose.yml file is located and run:

```
docker-compose up
```

Although you can run it using the `-d` flag, I wouldn't recommend do so.
I mean... it's for CI after all!
